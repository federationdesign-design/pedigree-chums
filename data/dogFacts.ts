/* THE PIT'S "DID YOU KNOW?" FACTS, 25 September 2026 (owner: random dog facts
   from everything the site already holds, not just the breed write-ups).
   Built once, from:
     1. the history page's "Did you know?" facts (historySections.ts);
     2. the chatbot's approved breed lines (copied from the pick-a-chum branch's
        assembler, where they are BREED_FACTS; not on main otherwise);
     3. the famous dogs (famousDogs.ts), written as a sentence each;
     4. the first sentence of every breed write-up (breedInfo.ts).
   The pit adds the current level's lineage notes on top and deals the lot from
   a shuffled deck. To add facts, add them to EXTRA_FACTS. */
